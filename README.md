# RTOS From Scratch on ARM - Study Material
 RealTime OS (RTOS) From Ground Up on ARM

This repository serves as study material for building a **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** from scratch on **ARM-based processors**, based on a comprehensive course. The project provides hands-on exercises and detailed examples to help you understand and implement the inner workings of an RTOS.

Throughout this project, you will learn about the essential components of an RTOS, such as task scheduling, memory management, interrupt handling, and ARM-specific optimizations. You will then implement these components from the ground up, giving you a deep understanding of how real-time systems operate and how to develop them for ARM-based microcontrollers.

By the end of this project, you'll have the skills to design and implement a complete **RTOS** and understand key scheduling algorithms, memory management techniques, and more.

## Key Learnings
This study material will guide you through:
- **Building an RTOS from scratch**: Learn how to design and implement a Real-Time Operating System from the ground up.
- **Developing scheduling algorithms**: Implement **Round-Robin**, **Cooperative**, **Periodic**, **First-Come-First-Served**, and **Rate Monotonic** schedulers.
- **Creating a Board Support Package (BSP)**: Build a BSP to interface your RTOS with hardware.
- **Optimizing CPU utilization**: Learn how to calculate and analyze CPU usage for efficient real-time operation.
- **Writing low-level code**: Gain experience with **Embedded-C** and **Assembly** code for bare-metal development.
- **Understanding ARM Cortex-M architecture**: Explore ARM-specific features that support real-time operating systems, including SysTick timers and the NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller).
- **Exploring RTOS Kernel internals**: Understand the internal workings of the RTOS kernel and popular scheduling algorithms.
