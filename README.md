# RTOS From Scratch on ARM - Study Material

This repository contains my personal study material and implementation notes for building a **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** from scratch on **ARM-based processors**. It serves as a collection of practical exercises, code snippets, and implementation details that I have used to understand and create the internals of an RTOS.

Throughout this project, I explored the key concepts of RTOS design, including task scheduling, memory management, interrupt handling, and ARM-specific optimizations. By implementing the components myself, I gained a deeper understanding of how real-time systems work and how to build them for ARM-based microcontrollers.

### Key Areas Covered:
- **Building an RTOS**: Implementing the core components of a real-time operating system.
- **Task Scheduling**: Developing **Round-Robin**, **Cooperative**, **Periodic**, **First-Come-First-Served**, and **Rate Monotonic** scheduling algorithms.
- **Memory Management**: Creating basic dynamic memory allocation and task stack management.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Managing interrupts with ARM's **NVIC** and **SysTick** timer.
- **ARM Cortex-M Architecture**: Leveraging ARM features for efficient real-time operation, including timer and interrupt handling.
